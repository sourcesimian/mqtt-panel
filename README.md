MQTT Panel <!-- omit in toc -->
===

***Self hosted Web App panel for MQTT***

This project provides a self hostable service that connects to a MQTT broker and serves a progressive web app panel which is fully configurable via YAML. It aims to be a simple panel that gives user interactivity with MQTT topics. Suitable for standalone or MQTT microservice deployments, and can be deployed alongside home automation solutions. It does not offer higher level capabilities such as automations, integrations or scheduling.

</div>

# Installation
Prebuilt container images are available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/sourcesimian/mqtt-panel).

## Docker
Run
```
mkdir -p $HOME/.cache/mqtt-panel

docker run -n mqtt-panel -d -it --rm -p 8080:8080 \
    --volume my-config.yaml:/config.yaml:ro \
    --volume $HOME/.cache/mqtt-panel:/data/cache:rw \
    sourcesimian/mqtt-panel:latest
```

## Kubernetes
Configure your Deployment to suffice the docker configuration above. Additionally you can add a liveness endpoint at `/api/health` on the configured http port. To perform SSL endpoint termination you can add an ingress controller such as [Traefik](https://traefik.io/) which comes standard with [K3s](https://k3s.io/).

A typical Deployment might include:
```
      volumes:
      - name: config
        configMap:
          name: mqtt-panel-config
      - name: data
        hostPath:
          path: /mnt/mqtt-panel/data
          type: DirectoryOrCreate
```

```
      containers:
      - name: mqtt-panel
        image: sourcesimian/mqtt-panel:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
        volumeMounts:
        - name: config
          mountPath: /config.yaml
          subPath: config.yaml
        - name: data
          mountPath: /data
        livenessProbe:
          initialDelaySeconds: 30
          periodSeconds: 30
          httpGet:
            path: /api/health
            port: 8080
```
Kubernetes allows for the config file to be supplied in various ways. Using a ConfigMap the following commands are a convienient way to supply and update directly from your YAML:
```
kubectl -n "$NAMESPACE" delete configmap mqtt-panel-config &>/dev/null || true
kubectl -n "$NAMESPACE" create configmap mqtt-panel-config \
        --from-file=config.yaml=./config-my.yaml
kubectl -n "$NAMESPACE" rollout restart deploy mqtt-panel
```

## MQTT Infrastructure
An installation of **mqtt-panel** will need a MQTT broker to connect to. There are many possibilities available. In the demo [EMQ X](https://www.emqx.io/), a free Open-Source, Cloud-Native broker, is used. You can subscribe to `sourcesimian/mqtt-panel/demo/#` with your favourite MQTT viewer. [Eclipse Mosquitto](https://github.com/eclipse/mosquitto/blob/master/README.md) is a great self-hosted option with many ways of installation including pre-built containers on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/eclipse-mosquitto).

To compliment your MQTT infrastructure you may consider the following other microservices:
| Service | Description |
|---|---|
| [mqtt-gpio](https://github.com/sourcesimian/mqtt-gpio/blob/main/README.md) | Connects MQTT topics to GPIO pins. |
| [mqtt-ical](https://github.com/sourcesimian/mqtt-ical/blob/main/README.md) | Publishes values to MQTT topics based on events in an iCal Calendar. |
| [mqtt-kube](https://github.com/sourcesimian/mqtt-kube/blob/main/README.md) | Maps Kubernetes object values to and from topics on MQTT. |
| [NodeRED](https://nodered.org/) | A flow-based visual programming tool for wiring together devices, with built in MQTT integration and many others available. Can easily be used to add higher level behaviours. |

# Configuration
`mqtt-panel` consumes a single [YAML](https://yaml.org/) file. To start off you can copy [config-basic.yaml](./config-basic.yaml)

## Conventions
The following are conventions that are used in the YAML configuration:
| Item | Description |
|---|---|
| `<string>` | Any string of characters, preferably "quoted" to avoid YAML from interpreting in a different way. |
| `<icon>` | These are `material-icons` from the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/icons) library. |
| `<color>` | Is any HTML style color, e.g. `red`, `"#F04040"`, `rgb(240, 64, 64)`, etc. Use "quotes" to ensure that the `#` is not interpreted as a comment.|
| `<topic>` | A MQTT topic, e.g. `fizz/buzz/status`. Subscriptions can also accept the `*` and `#` wildcards. Use "quotes" to ensure that the `#` is not interpreted as a comment.
| `<identifier>` | A string of alpha-numeric characters, and `_` |

```

## Logging
```
logging:
  level: INFO                   # optional: Logging level, default DEBUG
```

## Panels
`mqtt-panel` is divided into panels, one panel is show at a time, each panel is a collection of groups.
```
panels:
  - title: <string>             # Panel title text
    icon: <icon>                # Icon shown on the menu bar
    groups:                     # list of group identifiers
      - <identifier>            # e.g. "group_one"
  ... (repeat)
```

## Groups
A group is a boxed collection of widgets. They can be reused on multiple panels.
```
groups:
  - title: <string>             # Title text
    name: <identifier>          # Identifier, e.g. "group_one"
    widgets:                    # List of widgets in ths group
    ... (widgets)
  ... (repeat)
```

## Widgets
A widget is a functional element, which is used to publish and/or subscribe to MQTT topics, and display and/or input some payload.

All widgets have the following common attributes.:
```
    - title: <string>           # Title text
      type: <type>              # Widget type
      qos: [0 | 1 | 2]          # optional: MQTT QoS to use, default: 1
      retain: [False | True]    # optional: Publish with MQTT retain flag, default: False
      cache: [False | True]     # optional: Cache last seen payloads, default: False
      ref: <widget reference>   # optional: Identifier string for widget reuse.
```
`retain` is a flag that is set when publishing a payload to MQTT. If set the message will persist in the broker, clients will re-receive that payload when reconnecting. This does not always give the desired behaviour.

You will note that at startup some widgets show "unknown" until a payload on the subscribed MQTT topic is recieved. To improve user experience of mqtt-panel `cache: True` will preserve the last seen payload for a widget. This enables the server to immediately show the last known state after a restart, even with a MQTT topic using `retain: False`.

To reuse a widget add the `ref` attribute, and then add the widget to other groups as:
```
    - ref: <widget reference>  # Identifier of widget to reuse
```

### Text
<!-- include:begin mqtt_panel/web/widget/text.md -->
Simply display the payload of the subscribed MQTT topic.
```
    - title: <string>       # Title text

      color: <color>        # optional: Color of the text
```
Example:
```
    - title: My Text
      type: text

        text: "Gentle"
        icon: volume_mute
        color: "#02b002"
      - range: [30, 70]
        text: "Medium"
        icon: volume_down

        text: "Loud"
        icon: volume_up
        color: "#b03c02"
```
<!-- include:end -->

### Slider
<!-- include:begin mqtt_panel/web/widget/slider.md -->
Show the received value and a vertical bar gauge where the text, icon and color will change based on the value of the subscribed payload. Additionally when tapped, show a slider which can be used to input and publish a value between the max and min value.

```
    - title: <string>       # Title text
      type: slider          # Widget type
      live: [False | True]  # optional: Realtime publishing. Default: False
      ... (same as gauge)
```
Setting `live: True` the current value of the slider will be published as it changes. The default behaviour is to publish only the final selected value when the slider is released.
<!-- include:end -->

### Select
<!-- include:begin mqtt_panel/web/widget/select.md -->
Display some text, an icon and color when the defined payloads are received from the subscribed topic. When tapped, shows a list of the other values which can be published.

      publish: <topic>      # MQTT topic to write to
      subscribe: <topic>    # optional: MQTT topic to listen on
      values:
      - payload: <string>     # Payload to send and match
        text: <string>        # optional: Text shown
        icon: <icon>          # optional: Icon shown
        color: <color>        # optional: Color of icon and text
      ... (repeat)

        icon: rowing
        color: cyan
      - text: "Cape Town"
        payload: "Mountain"
        icon: landscape
        color: green
```
<!-- include:end -->

### Iframe
<!-- include:begin mqtt_panel/web/widget/iframe.md -->
Display content in a `<iframe>`. The `src` attribute can be bound to a MQTT topic.
```
    - title: <string>       # Title text
      type: iframe          # Widget type
      subscribe: <topic>    # optional: MQTT topic to listen on, bound to iframe 'src'
      refresh: <seconds>    # optional: Interval at which to refresh the iframe
      attr:                 # Attributes to be set on the iframe
        src: <url>            # optional: Can be set as a default vaule for 'src'
        ...                   # additional attributes

# Contribution
Yes sure! And please. I built mqtt-panel because I couldn't find a "I'm not ready to commit to full blown HA yet" solution that was self hosted and server side configurable. I don't know much about contemporary HTML, CSS and Typescript so I will gladly accept advice from those who know more. I want it to be a project that is quick and easy to get up and running, and helps open up MQTT to anyone. [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md)

Before pushing a PR please consider adding unit tests and ensure that `make check` and `make test` are clean.

## Development
Setup the virtualenv:

```
python3 -m venv virtualenv
. ./virtualenv/bin/activate
python3 ./setup.py develop
```

Run the server:

```
mqtt-panel ./config-demo.yaml
```
