# Running
## Demo
Run
```
docker run -it --rm -p 8080:8080 sourcesimian/mqtt-panel:latest
```
and browse to http://localhost:8080

## Docker
Run
```
mkdir -p $HOME/.cache/mqtt-panel

docker run -n mqtt-panel -d -it --rm -p 8080:8080 \
    --volume my-config.yaml:/config.yaml:ro \
    --volume $HOME/.cache/mqtt-panel:/data/cache:rw \
    sourcesimian/mqtt-panel:latest
```

## Kubernetes
Configure your Deployment to suffice the docker configuration above. Additionally you can add a liveness endpoint at `/api/health` on the configured http port. Additionally you can add an ingress controller such as Traefik to perform SSL endpoint termination.

# Configuration
`mqtt-panel` consumes a single YAML file. To start off you can copy [config-basic.yaml](./config-basic.yaml)

```
mqtt:
  host: <host>                  # optional: MQTT broker host, default: 127.0.0.1
  port: <port>                  # optional: MQTT broker port, default 1883
  username: <string>            # optional: MQTT broker username
  password: <string>            # optional: MQTT password username
  client-id: mqtt-panel         # MQTT client identifier, often brokers require this to be unique
  topic-prefix: <topic prefix>  # optional: Scopes the MQTT topic prefix
```
```
http:
  bind: <bind>                  # optional: Interface on which web server will listen, default 0.0.0.0
  port: <port>                  # Port on which web server will listen, default 1883
  max-connections: <integer>    # optional: Limit the number of concurrent connections, default 100
```
```
auth:                           # User Auth
  users:                        # optional: User/password auth
  - username: <string>
    password: <string>
```
```
cache:                          # Configure cache
  root: <path>                  # optional root path, default ./cache
```
```
logging:                        # Logging settings
  level: INFO                   # optional: Logging level, default DEBUG
```

## Panels
`mqtt-panel` is divided into panels, one panel is show at a time, each panel is a collection of groups.
```
panels:
  - title: <string>             # Panel title text
    icon: widgets               # Icon shown on the menu bar
    groups:                     # list of group identifiers
      - <identifier>            # e.g. "group_one"
  ... (repeat)
```


## Groups
A group is a boxed collection of widgets. They can be reused on multiple panels.
```
groups:
  - title: <string>             # Title text
    name: <identifier>          # Identifier, e.g. "group_one"
    widgets:                    # List of widgets in ths group
    ... (widgets)
  ... (repeat)
```

## Widgets
A widget is a functional element, which is used to publish and/or subscribe to MQTT topics, and display and/or input some payload.

All widgets have the following common attributes.:
```
    - title: <string>           # Title text
      type: <type>              # Widget type
      qos: [0 | 1 | 2]          # optional: MQTT QoS to use, default: 1
      retain: [False | True]    # optional: Publish with MQTT retain flag, default: False
      cache: [False | True]     # optional: Cache last seen payloads, default: False
      ref: <widget reference>   # optional: Identifier string for widget reuse.
```
`retain` is a flag that is set when publishing a payload to MQTT. If set the message will persist in the broker, clients will re-receive that payload when reconnecting. This does not always give the desired behaviour.

You will note that at startup some widgets show "unknown" until a payload on the subscribed MQTT topic is recieved. To improve user experience of mqtt-panel `cache: True` will preserve the last seen payload for a widget. This enables the server to immediately show the last known state after a restart, even with a MQTT topic using `retain: False`. 

To reuse a widget add the `ref` attribute, and then add the widget to other groups as:
```
    - ref: <widget reference>  # Identifier of widget to reuse
```


### Text
<!-- include:begin mqtt_panel/web/widget/text.md -->
Simply display the payload of the subscribed MQTT topic.
```
    - title: <string>       # Title text

      subscribe: <topic>    # MQTT topic to listen on
      color: <color>        # optional: Color of the text
```
Example:
```
    - title: My Text
      type: text
      subscribe: text/content

```
<!-- include:end --> 
### Light
<!-- include:begin mqtt_panel/web/widget/light.md -->

```
    - title: <string>       # Title text
      type: gauge           # Widget type
      subscribe: <topic>    # MQTT topic to listen on
      icon: <icon>          # optional: The default icon
      ranges:

# Contribution
Yes sure! And please. I built mqtt-panel because I couldn't find a "I'm not ready to commit to full blown HA yet" solution that was self hosted and server side configurable. I don't know much about contemporary HTML, CSS and Typescript so I will gladly accept advice from those who know more. I want it to be a project that is quick and easy to get up and running, and helps open up MQTT to anyone.
## Development
Setup the virtualenv:

```
python3 -m venv virtualenv
. ./virtualenv/bin/activate
python3 ./setup.py develop
```

Run the server:

```
mqtt-panel ./config-demo.yaml
```
